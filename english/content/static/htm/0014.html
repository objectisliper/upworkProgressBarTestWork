						<td>Adware</td>
						<td>Adware stands for advertising malware; it is a type of malicious software that
						presents unwanted advertisements using intrusive and disruptive techniques. It could 
						manifest itself in the form of endless popups, or use a type of spyware that tracks
						your online activity to make the adverts more targeted.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Antivirus</td>
						<td>Antivirus software is used to monitor a computer or network, to detect cyber

						the presence of a threat, antivirus programs may also remove or neutralise malicious code.</td>
					</tr>

					</tr>

 					<tr>
						<td>Brute force attack</td>

						computer networks, programs and data against malicious attacks and unauthorised access.</td>
					</tr>

					</tr>
					
					<tr>

					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Incident</td>

						unauthorised access, the unauthorised use of systems for the processing or storing of data,
						malicious disruption or denial of service, and changes to a system’s firmware, software or
						hardware without the owner’s consent.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Information security policy</td>
						<td>The directives, regulations, rules, and practices that form an organisation’s strategy 
						for managing, protecting and distributing information.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Internet of things (IoT)</td>
						<td>The ability of everyday objects, such as kettles, fridges and televisions, to connect
						to the internet.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>IP spoofing</td>

						systems who believe they are communicating directly with each other. It is used either to
						harvest the information being transmitted or perhaps to alter it.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Password sniffing</td>

						or account details, usually by leading them to a fake website.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Ransomware</td>
						<td>The clue is in the name. This is a type of malware that restricts access to or encrypts
						the contents of someone’s computer or device, and asks them for money to be paid in order for
						access to be restored.<br><br>
						As is typical with ransom cases, there is no guarantee that access will be restored once the
						money has been paid. The most effective protection against this is to backup your data in
						several different places, to make it more difficult for your digital property to be commandeered.
						</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Shoulder surfing</td>
						<td>A more old-fashioned practice, but one that is always worth watching out for, shoulder
						surfing is the simple act of looking over a users shoulder to extract sensitive data such
						as a password, PIN or other private details.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Smishing</td>
						<td>Smishing is the same as phishing, except the contact comes in the form of a text message.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Social engineering</td>
						<td>This type of attack takes advantage of people’s natural instinct to trust others and take
						things at face value. It could come in the form of impersonation, lies, psychological tricks 
						and even threats, and is used to extract sensitive data such as passwords and other details
						that will grant the attacker unauthorised access to their target.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Spear phishing</td>
						<td>While phishing attacks usually come in the form of mass, untargeted emails, spear phishing
						is a highly personalised and planned attack designed to look like it’s from someone the
						recipient knows or trusts. It will often be delivered with a sense of urgency that helps
						to side-step the victim’s suspicions and leaves them no time to double check information.</td>
					</tr>
 
					<tr>
						<td>Spoofing</td>
						<td>This is essentially disguising an online communication with a malicious intention as
						something benign. Spoofing can come in the form of emails, caller ID, entire websites, IP 
						addresses and more. They are best spotted by closely checking an email sender or website
						address, and watching out for spelling mistakes or strange use of grammar.</td>
					</tr>
 
					<tr>
						<td>Spyware</td>
						<td>A type of malware that spys on a victim’s computer or device usage to extract sensitive
						information without their knowledge. Keyloggers and screen scrapers are both types of spyware.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>SSL / Secure Sockets Layer</td>
						<td>This is an encryption method to ensure the safety of the data sent and received from a 
						user to a specific website and back. Encrypting this data transfer ensures that no one can
						snoop on the transmission and gain access to confidential information, such as card details
						in the case of online shopping. Legitimate websites use SSL (start with https). Users should 
						avoid inputting their data in websites that don’t use SSL.</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Trojan horse</td>
						<td>Inspired by the Trojan Horse of greek mythology, in cyber security it means a computer
						program that appears to have a useful function, but has a true purpose of breaching the
						security of a computer system. It relates to anything that misleads the user about its
						true intent.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Virus</td>
						<td>Programs that can self-replicate and are designed to infect legitimate software
						programs or systems. A form of malware.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Vishing</td>
						<td>Vishing is just like phishing, except it happens on the phone. On the other end could
						be a computerised voice giving you some sort of warning unless you act immediately, or it
						could be an actual person asking you to follow instructions or divulge security details.
						As with phishing, smishing, spear phishing and social engineering, urgency is usually
						applied in an attempt to sidestep any kind of urge to double-check or second guess.</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Whaling</td>
						<td>Highly targeted phishing attacks that are specifically aimed at senior executives who
						have a high level of access permissions.</tr>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Worm</td>
						<td>A self-replicating, self-propagating, self-contained program that uses networking
						mechanisms to spread itself.</td>
					</tr>
